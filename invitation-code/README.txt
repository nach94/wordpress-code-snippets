Hi!

This snippet add this function for your Wordpress website:

路 Field text in native Login Wordpress Form to insert an invitation code.
路 The value will compare with an user metafield (custom invitation code) to allow the sing in.
路 The field will be mandatory to log in at Wordpress.

Advice:
路 Create the meta field using the plugin "Advanced Custom Fields" or "JetEngine" to use this snippet.
